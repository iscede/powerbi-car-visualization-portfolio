# Car Visualization (Power BI)

Portfolio project built with **Power BI Desktop**.

This repository contains the report file and documentation so recruiters can quickly understand **what I built, why, and how**.

## What you’ll find here

- **Power BI report:** [`powerbi/Car_visualization.pbix`](powerbi/Car_visualization.pbix)
- **Report structure (auto-generated):** [`docs/notes/report_pages_and_visuals.md`](docs/notes/report_pages_and_visuals.md)
- **Screenshots (add yours):** `docs/images/`

## Report pages

- **Página 1** — Main dashboard (KPIs + trends + breakdowns)
- **TT Modelos** — Tooltip page (details by model)

> Tip: Add 2–4 screenshots in `docs/images/` and embed them below so the repo can be understood without opening Power BI.

## Key skills demonstrated

- Data modeling (relationships, star-schema thinking)
- DAX measures for KPIs
- Dashboard design (visual hierarchy, tooltips, slicers)

## How to open

1. Install **Power BI Desktop** (Windows).
2. Download this repo as ZIP (or clone it).
3. Open `powerbi/Car_visualization.pbix`.

If your PBIX uses a local file path as a data source, update it in:
**Transform data (Power Query) → Data source settings → Change source…** then **Refresh**.

## Suggested screenshots to add

Create these in Power BI (File → Export → or just take screenshots):

- Full dashboard view (main page)
- Tooltip in action (hover on a model)
- Filters/slicers used in the analysis

Then place them in `docs/images/` and embed them here, for example:

```md
![Dashboard](docs/images/dashboard.png)
```
