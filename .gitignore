# --- Power BI ---
# PBIX/PBIT are binary. You *can* version them in GitHub for a portfolio,
# but diffs won't be readable. If you prefer to keep them out of Git:
#   1) keep the rules below
#   2) export a PDF + screenshots to /docs/images
#   3) optionally commit a .pbit template (no data) instead of the .pbix

*.pbix
*.pbit
*.pbip
*.pbiq

# Allow the portfolio PBIX in this repo:
!powerbi/Car_visualization.pbix

# --- OS / Editor ---
